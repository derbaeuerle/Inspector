Inspector
==========

Inspector is a Android libray to make Android Applications accessible over Http requests.
Every Request will get an JSON string as return value, which can be used in other applications
such as web applications.
Beneath the Android implementation there is a JavaScript library, which can be used to access
Apps from a browser running on the android device. Maybe this will be extended to access over
network, so the app can be accessed by computers inside the same network.
